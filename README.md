# Southern Water Leakage Root Cause Analysis

## **Project Description**

This project was divided into 2 phases, 1a and 1b.

### **Phase 1**a

Southern Water's goal of reducing leakage by 15% was  reliant on our findings in this project. Legacy Seams, working alongside Arcadis were tasked with testing several hypotheses linked to causing leakage in the SW network. These included:

- weather and seasonal variations
- capital programme targeting
- asset base inherent impacts
- NRR behaviours
- Regional discrepancies
- Property data

We generated reports for Phase 1a which are included in the file location link below. For more information on this, check out this file -> Hypothesis and Data Map spreadsheet (2. Hypothesis - Outline)

### **Phase 1b**

This was more of an Arcadis-led project. Legacy Seams carried out basic data cleaning and exploratory activities and data visualisation. It involved diving deeper into some of the hypothesis above and can be found in this file -> Hypothesis and Data Map spreadsheet (3.1 Hypothesis and Experiments).

## **Status**

Work done by Arcadis and "Legacy Seams" in Phase 1b won 2 awards, one each in Arcadis and Southern Water (SW). The monetary proceeds from the SW win were donated to charity.

## **Scripts**

Due to the fast pace of this projects, the scripts, which have been added to github are poorly written and have not been cleansed properly due to lack of time.
